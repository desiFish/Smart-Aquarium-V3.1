## 🔄 Scalability

This system is highly scalable and can be easily modified to control more or fewer relays:

1. **Hardware Scaling**
   - Simply adjust the number of relays and GPIO pins in the main program
   - Update pin definitions in the configuration section

2. **Interface Scaling**
   - Modify the relay count in the JavaScript array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Add or remove corresponding div blocks in `index.html` and `settings.html`
   - The web interface automatically adapts to the number of configured relays

3. **Memory Considerations**
   - ESP8266 can theoretically handle up to 16 relays
   - Each relay requires approximately:
     - 2KB of program memory
     - 100 bytes of RAM for state management
     - Minimal impact on web interface size
   - **Professional Note:** Based on my experience, it is advisable not to exceed 5-6 relays in practical deployments. This is due to the significant number of API calls occurring in the background, which may impact system reliability. As the system has not been stress tested with higher relay counts, I cannot guarantee stable operation beyond this range.

> 💡 **Scaling Tip**: When modifying the number of relays, ensure you update all three components:
> 1. Hardware GPIO definitions
> 2. JavaScript relay array
> 3. HTML interface elements

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 12-E NodeMCU Development Board (or any compatible ESP8266 module)
- DS3231 RTC Module
- 4-Channel Relay Module
- Power Supply (5V)  
  - *Ensure the power supply is well-filtered and of good quality to avoid instability or malfunction. A more robust power supply circuit is currently under development and will be made available in the future.*
- WiFi Connection

> 💡 **Compatibility**: While this project is developed and tested on the ESP8266 12-E NodeMCU Kit, it should work on other ESP8266-based development boards with minimal modifications. Just ensure your board has enough GPIO pins for the relay and RTC connections.

### Circuit Diagram
![Hardware Connections](src/schematics.png)

The above schematic shows the connections between the ESP8266, RTC module, and relay module. Make sure to follow the pin connections exactly as shown for proper functionality.

## 🕒 NTP Time Offset and Server Selection

Previously, the NTP time offset and server were set manually in the code using a line such as:
```cpp
NTPClient timeClient(ntpUDP, "in.pool.ntp.org", 19800);
```
- The third parameter, `19800`, is the time offset in **seconds** for your timezone (e.g., 19800 seconds = 5 hours 30 minutes for IST).

**Now, the NTP server and timezone can be configured directly from the Settings page of the web interface.**
- Simply provide your preferred NTP server and select your timezone in the settings.
- The program will automatically calculate the correct time offset based on your selection, eliminating the need for manual calculation or code changes.

**How it works:**
- The system uses your selected timezone to determine the offset in seconds.
- The NTP server address is updated as per your input in the settings.

**Example:**
- If you select Central European Time (CET, UTC+1) in the settings, the program will automatically use an offset of 3600 seconds and update the NTP server accordingly.

This makes the system more flexible and user-friendly, allowing for easy adjustments without modifying the code.

## 📦 Dependencies

> ⚠️ **Important**: The following specific libraries are required for compatibility. Using different versions may cause stability issues.

- ESP8266WiFi (Built-in with ESP8266 Arduino Core)
- [ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncTCP) - **Required Latest Version**
- [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer) - **Required Latest Version**
- LittleFS (Built-in with ESP8266 Arduino Core)
- ArduinoJson
- [RTClib](https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib) - **Required Latest Version**
- ElegantOTA
- NTPClient

All libraries can be installed through the Arduino Library Manager. These specific libraries are mandatory for proper functionality of the ElegantOTA system.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/desiFish/Smart-Aquarium-V3.1.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Arduino IDE

3. Install required libraries through Arduino Library Manager

4. Initial Setup (Wired Upload - One time only):
   - Connect ESP8266 to your computer via USB
   - Install "ESP8266 LittleFS Data Upload" tool in Arduino IDE ([Installation Guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp8266-littlefs/))
   - Ensure the `data` folder contains `index.html`, `settings.html`, and `favicon.jpg` with exact folder structure
   - Upload HTML files using the guide above
   - Upload the code from Arduino IDE
   - After successful code upload, the device will create a WiFi access point (hotspot) named `Aquarium-Setup` with password `12345678`. Connect to this network using any device (preferably a PC). Ignore any alert about "connected with no internet." Open a browser and go to `192.168.4.1`. Navigate to the Settings page, enter your WiFi credentials, and click on "Save WiFi." The device will then reboot and attempt to connect to your configured network.

   **Dynamic vs Static IP:**
   - By default, the device uses **Dynamic IP (DHCP)**. This means your WiFi router will automatically assign an available IP address to the device. This is recommended for most users and ensures easy connectivity.
   - However, with Dynamic IP, the assigned address may change every time the device or router restarts. This can be inconvenient, as you may need to keep searching for the new IP address to access the device.
   - If you are not sure what to use for static IP, simply fill in your WiFi SSID and password, do NOT check the "Use Static IP" slider, and click on "Save WiFi." When the device reboots, find the new IP assigned to it from your router's device list or any router app. Open that IP in your browser; the Smart Aquarium V3.1 page will open. Go to Settings again and click on "Make this static IP." The device will set the current router-assigned IP settings as static and reboot. Now you can keep using the same IP without worries.
   - If you want the device to always have the same IP address (for example, for port forwarding or remote access), you can configure a **Static IP** in the Settings page. Enter the desired IP address, gateway, subnet mask, and DNS information. Make sure the static IP is not already in use on your network to avoid conflicts.
   - If you are unsure, use Dynamic IP (leave static IP fields blank or disabled in the Settings page).

   **RTC Synchronization and Browser Notification:**
   - The browser will notify you if the RTC (Real Time Clock) is not synchronized by comparing the RTC time with your current device (PC/Smartphone) time.
   - On the Settings page, the RTC time is displayed just under the main buttons. If the RTC is not connected or there is an error, it will show `RTC_ERROR` instead of the time. This is a reliable place to check RTC status.
   - If you notice the RTC time is incorrect, scroll to the bottom of the Settings page and select the nearest NTP pool server to you (if unsure, use `pool.ntp.org`) and set your timezone. Save the settings, it will automatically update RTC from the NTP server.
   - The browser updates the RTC time shown on the Settings page every 30 seconds, so the displayed time will always be within ±1 second of the actual RTC time.

5. Filesystem and Future Updates (Wireless/OTA):
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` in Arduino IDE (or follow the [guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp8266-littlefs/)) to launch ESP8266 LittleFS Data Upload tool
   - **Note:** The LittleFS uploader tool requires a COM port to be selected, even if the ESP8266 is not connected. You must select a port such as `COM3 [Not Connected]` in the Arduino IDE. If no COM port is available, the upload will fail.
   - When it fails (as ESP8266 is not connected via USB), check the error message
   - Locate the generated binary file path from the error message (usually in the temporary build folder)
   ![LittleFS Binary Location](src/littleFS.jpg)     
   - Access the ElegantOTA interface at `http://[ESP-IP]/update`
   - For filesystem updates: Select "LittleFS/SPIFFS" mode and upload the LittleFS binary (.bin)
   - For code updates: Select "Firmware" mode and upload the generated .bin file after compiling the sketch in Arduino IDE

> - [ElegantOTA Async Configuration](https://docs.elegantota.pro/getting-started/async-mode)

### ⚡ Optional: Direct Binary Uploads from Releases

Pre-built binary files are provided for convenience in the [Releases section](https://github.com/desiFish/Smart-Aquarium-V3.1/releases):

- `filesystem.littlefs.bin` — LittleFS filesystem image for direct upload
- `firmware-esp8266.esp8266.nodemcuv2.bin` — Compiled firmware for NodeMCU v2

You can upload these files directly using the ElegantOTA web interface:
- Go to `http://[ESP-IP]/update`
- Select the appropriate mode ("LittleFS/SPIFFS" for filesystem, "Firmware" for code)
- Upload the corresponding `.bin` file from the release assets

> This is the fastest way to update your device without compiling or using the Arduino IDE.

> ⚠️ **Configuration Persistence**: When updating the filesystem through OTA, all configuration data stored in LittleFS will be erased. This includes NTP settings, WiFi details (including static IP configuration), relay names, schedules, and any other custom settings. You'll need to:
> - Rename relays
> - Reset schedules and timers
> - Reconfigure NTP, WiFi, and static IP settings
> - Reconfigure any other custom settings
> This only applies to filesystem updates, not firmware updates.

## 🗄️ Backup and Restore

The system provides a simple backup and restore feature for your convenience:

- **Backup:** Click the Backup button on the Settings page to save all current configuration data (including WiFi, NTP, static IP, relay names, schedules, and more) to your PC or smartphone as a single file. The backup file will be named as `aquariumBackup<date>.json` (e.g., `aquariumBackup30062025.json`). This is highly recommended before performing any software or hardware updates.

- **Restore:** To restore, simply select your backup file using the Restore option on the Settings page. The system will restore everything—literally all your previous settings and configuration will be reinstated automatically.

This makes it easy to recover your setup after updates or hardware changes, ensuring a seamless experience.

> ⚡ **Performance Tip:** Be sure to select **160 MHz CPU speed** from Arduino IDE → Tools. This project will work just fine on 80 MHz, but 160 MHz is recommended for the best experience.

> ⚠️ **Note:** In rare cases, the restore process may fail due to browser or network issues. If this happens, simply reload the page and try the restore again.

> 💡 **Tip**: After the initial wired upload, all future updates can be done wirelessly through ElegantOTA. This includes both code and filesystem updates. Just make sure to have backup.

## ⚠️ Important Troubleshooting

> 🔴 **Critical**: If the server fails to start or the code doesn't work, the most common cause is incorrect static IP configuration. You have two options:
> 1. **Remove Static IP**: Comment out or remove the static IP configuration code to use DHCP (recommended for beginners)
> 2. **Configure Static IP**: Ensure your static IP settings match your network configuration:
>    ```cpp
>    local_IP(192, 168, 1, 200);     // Choose an unused IP in your network
>    gateway(192, 168, 1, 1);        // Your router's IP address
>    subnet(255, 255, 255, 0);       // Your network's subnet mask
>    ```
> Most connection issues are resolved by either switching to DHCP or correctly configuring these values!

> 💡 **Don't worry, I've got you covered!** Even if you don't know how to set a static IP, just enter your WiFi name (SSID) and password, and hit "Save WiFi." Upon restart, your router will automatically assign the device a new IP address. To find out what IP address was assigned, check your router's device list. If your router identifies devices by MAC address, simply go to the Hardware Info page in the web interface to find your device's MAC address.
>
> Now, after the device restarts and you log in with the new IP, you'll notice that the fields below WiFi name and password (subnet, gateway, etc.) are all filled in automatically. Just check the "Use custom static IP" option and click on "Make this static IP." The device will reboot, and from then on, you can always use this IP address to access your Smart Aquarium—no network knowledge required!
